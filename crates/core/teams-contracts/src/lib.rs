//! Wire contract for Ryu agent **teams** — the payloads that cross the loopback
//! boundary between Core and the out-of-process `ryu-teams` sidecar.
//!
//! A team is a persisted, ordered collection of agents addressed as one unit
//! (`@team` in chat) plus a **coordination strategy** deciding how the members
//! respond. The split of responsibilities is:
//!
//! - the **sidecar** (`apps-store/teams/backend`) owns `teams.db` and serves
//!   `/api/teams/*`, which Core re-exposes verbatim through the generic ext-proxy
//!   `public_mount`;
//! - **Core** owns the orchestration that *interprets* the strategy
//!   (`sidecar::adapters::route_team_chat_stream` / `run_team_reply_text`) and the
//!   `agent_builder.create_agent_team` roster minter, reaching the store over
//!   loopback HTTP (`crate::teams_client::TeamsClient`).
//!
//! Both halves need the same three shapes, and neither may link the other. This
//! crate is that shared middle: `serde`-only, no `apps/core` dependency, no
//! `rusqlite`. Same topology as [`ryu-notify`](https://docs.rs/ryu-notify) between
//! Core and the monitors sidecar.
//!
//! What is deliberately NOT here: `UpdateTeam` and its `double_option` tri-state
//! helper. Those are the sidecar's own PATCH shape and Core never names them, so
//! they stay in `store.rs` rather than widening the contract.
